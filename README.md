WordPress powered by Docker! Now run WordPress anywhere you can install Docker.

## Installing / Getting started

This project depends on

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
3. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

_We're working on getting the dependencies installed by the install script. In
the meantime, please install the dependencies manually._

This project has an installer script that will install it locally.

You can fetch that script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EasyEngine/docker-compose-wordpress/master/scripts/setup -o setup.sh
bash setup.sh
```

## Usage

1. Create a WordPress site

```shell
ee4 create example.com --wp
```

2. Delete a site
```shell
ee4 delete example.com
```

3. Use wp-cli with a site
```shell
ee4 wp example.com theme list
```

Run `ee4 --help` for all commands.

## Configuration

The sites get created at `/var/www`. You can view and change the configuration
for any of the sites at `/var/www/SITE/config`

Run `ee4 restart SITE` to load new configuration.
